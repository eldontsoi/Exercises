    "\n",
    "no. I just have to remanipulate the algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "yes. this is easier because the calculations are not cramp together, which allows me to test each line before executing.\n"
